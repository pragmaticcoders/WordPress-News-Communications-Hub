## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Upload the `WordPress-News-Communications-Hub-main` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

####
**Important**: If you have a caching plugin installed with JavaScript minification or file concatenation enabled, make sure to add `nch-script.js` to the exclusion list. This ensures that the script functions correctly without interference from caching.


## Usage
### Adding New Notifications
After activating the plugin, you can add new notifications through the **News Communications Hub** admin menu:
- **Notification Title**: Set the title that will appear in the notification bar.
- **Post Type Selection**: Choose which post types (e.g., posts, pages, or any custom types) should appear in the notification. You can select multiple post types.
- **Custom Dates**: Specify start and end dates for each notification, allowing for precise control over when notifications are visible to users.
- **First-Time Visitor Options**: Choose whether a notification should be visible only for first-time visitors or for all subsequent visits.
- **Icons**: Select an icon for your notification from the Elementor icon library or use the default Dashicons from WordPress.

### Displaying Notifications
1. **Shortcode**: Use the `[pc-nch]` shortcode to display the notification bar on any page or post.
2. **Widget**: Alternatively, you can place the notification widget in any widgetized area of your theme (e.g., the sidebar or footer).
3. **Automatic Fetching**: The plugin can automatically fetch the latest posts or custom post types and display them as notifications.

### Managing Styles
All styles can be found in the `assets/css` folder. To modify the appearance of notifications, you can:
- Edit the provided CSS files.

### Notification Log
A log file is maintained at `logs/nch.log` to track important events such as errors, notification dispatches, and user interactions. This log can be useful for debugging issues or analyzing how notifications are being processed.

### Optimized Database Queries
The plugin is built with performance in mind, utilizing optimized database queries to minimize the load on the server. By caching results when appropriate and reducing the number of queries executed per page load, the plugin ensures a seamless experience for users while conserving server resources.
